# cohort-8-project

Cohort-8 created a clone of Base Camp entitled Home Base. <br>
<br>
To simulate what it is like to work in the real world as part of a larger engineering team, our students together built their "Cohort Project" in just 5 days, utilizing Agile Development methodologies. As a team, they self-assigned several roles, including "Product Owner (Rachel) ", "Designer" (Katy), "Front End Lead"(Hannah) and "Back End Lead" (Paul). Each member of the cohort who took on one of these roles also doubled as a developer on either the "Back End Team" or "Front End Team".
